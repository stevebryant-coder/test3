                <h4 id="Therapeutic_indications">4.1 Therapeutic indications </h4>
                <p><u>Psoriasis</u></p>
                <p>SKYRIZI is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults (18
                    years or older) who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.</p>

                <h4 id="Dose_and_method_of_administration">4.2 Dose and method of administration </h4>

                <p>The recommended dose is 150 mg (two 75 mg injections) administered by subcutaneous
                    injection at Week 0, Week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter</p>
                <p>Patients may self-inject SKYRIZI after training in subcutaneous injection technique. </p>
                <p>Patients should be instructed to inject 2 pre-filled syringes for the full 150 mg dose and to read
                    the Instructions for Use before administration. SKYRIZI is for single use in one patient only.
                    Discard any residue.</p>
                <p>For each dose, the injections should be administered at different anatomic locations (such as
                    thighs or abdomen), and not into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, erythematous,
                    indurated or affected by psoriasis. Administration of SKYRIZI in the upper, outer arm may only
                    be performed by a healthcare professional or caregiver. </p>
                <p>For a more comfortable injection, patients may remove the carton from the refrigerator before
                    injecting and allow to reach room temperature out of direct sunlight (15 to 30 minutes) without
                    removing the pre-filled syringes from the carton.</p>
                <p><u>Missed Dose</u></p>
                <p>If a dose is missed, administer the dose as soon as possible. Thereafter, resume dosing at
                    the regular scheduled time.</p>
                <h4 id="Contraindications">4.3 Contraindications </h4>
                <p>Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
                    Clinically important active infections.</p>

                <h4 id="Special_warnings_and_precautions_for_use">4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use </h4>
                <p><u>Infections</u></p>
                <p>SKYRIZI may increase the risk of infections.</p>
                <p>In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection, the risks and benefits
                    should be considered prior to prescribing SKYRIZI. Patients should be instructed to seek
                    medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important infection occur. If a patient develops
                    such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy for the infection, the patient should
                    be closely monitored and SKYRIZI should not be administered until the infection resolves.</p>
                <p><u>Tuberculosis </u></p>
                <p>Prior to initiating treatment with SKYRIZI, patients should be evaluated for TB infection.
                    SKYRIZI must not be given to patients with active TB. Patients receiving SKYRIZI should be
                    monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB. Anti-TB therapy should be considered prior
                    to initiating SKYRIZI in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate
                    course of treatment cannot be confirmed.</p>
                <p>Across the Phase 3 psoriasis clinical studies, of the 72 subjects with latent tuberculosis (TB)
                    who were concurrently treated with SKYRIZI and appropriate TB prophylaxis during the
                    studies, none developed active TB during the mean follow-up of 61 weeks on SKYRIZI. </p>

                <p><u>Immunisations </u></p>
                <p>Prior to initiating therapy with SKYRIZI, completion of all appropriate immunisations should be
                    considered according to current immunisation guidelines. SKYRIZI should not be used with
                    live vaccines. No data are available on the response to live or inactive vaccines.</p>
                <p><u>Hypersensitivity </u></p>
                <p>If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs, administration of risankizumab should be
                    discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.</p>
                <p><u>Use in Hepatic Impairment </u></p>
                <p>No specific studies were conducted to assess the effect of hepatic impairment on the
                    pharmacokinetics of SKYRIZI. This condition is generally not expected to have any significant
                    impact on the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies and no dose adjustments are
                    considered necessary (see <b>5.2 PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES).</b></p>
                <p><u>Use in Renal Impairment </u></p>
                <p>No specific studies were conducted to assess the effect of renal impairment on the
                    pharmacokinetics of SKYRIZI. This condition is generally not expected to have any significant
                    impact on the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies and no dose adjustments are
                    considered necessary (see <b>5.2 PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES).</b></p>
                <p><u>Use in the elderly </u></p>
                <p>No dose adjustment is required (see <b>5.2 PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES).</b> There is
                    limited information in subjects aged ≥ 65 years.</p>
                <p><u>Paediatric use</u></p>
                <p>The safety and effectiveness of SKYRIZI in patients less than 18 years of age have not yet
                    been established.</p>
                <p><u>Effects on laboratory tests</u></p>
                <p>No data available.</p>


                <h4 id="Interactions_with_other_medicines_and_other_forms_of_interactions">4.5 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions</h4>
                <p>SKYRIZI is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic enzymes or renal elimination.
                    Drug interactions between SKYRIZI and inhibitors/inducers of drug metabolising enzymes are
                    not expected.
                    Based on results from a drug-drug interaction study in subjects with plaque psoriasis and
                    population pharmacokinetic analyses, risankizumab is not expected to cause or be impacted
                    by drug-drug interactions (see <b>5.2 PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES - Drug Interactions).</b>
                    No dose adjustment is needed when co-administering risankizumab and cytochrome P450
                    substrates.</p>


                <h4 id="Fertility_pregnancy_and_lactation">4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation</h4>
                <p><u>Effects on fertility </u></p>
                <p>Studies in male cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week (about 70 times the
                    clinical exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) with risankizumab did
                    not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on male fertility. The effects of risankizumab were
                    not directly assessed in a dedicated fertility study in female animals. In the 26-week repeat
                    dose toxicology study, histopathology of reproductive organs from both male and female
                    cynomolgus monkeys did not show any relevant adverse finding. </p>

                <h4><u>Use in pregnancy (Pregnancy Category B1)</u></h4>
                <p>The limited data available with SKYRIZI use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform any
                    drug-associated risks. </p>
                <p>An enhanced pre- and post-natal developmental toxicity study was conducted in cynomolgus
                    monkeys. Pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered weekly subcutaneous doses of
                    risankizumab at 5 and 50 mg/kg from gestation day 20 to parturition and the cynomolgus
                    monkeys (mother and infants) were followed for 6 months (180 days) after delivery. These
                    doses produced exposures of up to approximately 99 times the clinical exposure at the MRHD.
                    No drug-related fetal/infant deaths and/or malformations were observed. There were no
                    effects on infant growth and development, which included the assessment of external, visceral,
                    skeletal and neurobehavioral parameters and developmental immuno-toxicology endpoints.
                    In the infants, mean serum concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner and were
                    approximately 17-86% of the respective maternal concentrations. Following delivery, most
                    adult female cynomolgus monkeys and all infants from the risankizumab-treated groups had
                    measurable serum concentrations of risankizumab up to 91 days postpartum. Serum
                    concentrations were below detectable levels at 180 days postpartum.</p>
                <p>SKYRIZI should be used in pregnancy only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks.</p>

                <p><u>Use in lactation </u></p>
                <p>It is unknown whether risankizumab is excreted in human milk. Human IgG’s are known to be
                    excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth, which decreases to low
                    concentrations soon afterwards; consequently, a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot be
                    excluded during this short period. A decision should be made whether to discontinue/abstain
                    from SKYRIZI therapy, taking into account, the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the
                    benefit of SKYRIZI therapy to the woman</p>

                <p>SKYRIZI has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.</p>

                <h4 id="Adverse_effects_Undesirable_effects">4.8 Adverse effects (Undesirable effects)</h4>
                <p>A total of 2234 subjects were treated with SKYRIZI in clinical development studies in plaque
                    psoriasis, representing 2167 subject-years of exposure. Of these, 1208 subjects with psoriasis
                    were exposed to SKYRIZI for at least one year.</p>
                <p>Data from placebo- and active-controlled studies were pooled to evaluate the safety of
                    SKYRIZI for up to 16 weeks. In total, 1306 subjects were evaluated in the SKYRIZI 150 mg
                    group. Serious adverse events occurred in 2.4% for the SKYRIZI group (9.9 events per 100
                    subject-years) compared to 4.0% for the placebo group (17.4 events per 100 subject-years),
                    5.0% for the ustekinumab group (18.4 events per 100 subject-years) and 3.0% for the
                    adalimumab group (14.7 events per 100 subject-years).</p>
                <p>Table 1 summarises the adverse reactions that occurred at ≥ 1% and at a higher rate in the
                    SKYRIZI group than the placebo group during the 16-week controlled period of pooled clinical
                    studies. Adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class.</p>

                    adalimumab group (104.2 events per 100 subject-years). The majority of cases were nonserious and mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of SKYRIZI.</p>
                <p>Over the entire psoriasis program including long-term exposure to SKYRIZI, the rate of
                    infections (75.5 events per 100 subject-years) was similar to that observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment.</p>
                <h4><u>Long-Term Safety</u></h4>
                <p>A total of 1091 patients had received at least 1 year of risankizumab treatment at the proposed
                    dose of 150 mg up to the time of submission. The frequency of adverse reactions was similar over the long term as that observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment. In ULTIMMA-1 and
                    ULTIMMA-2, through Week 52, the exposure-adjusted rates of serious adverse events per
                    100 subject-years were 9.4 for subjects treated with SKYRIZI and 10.9 for those treated with
                    ustekinumab. </p>
                <h4><u>Immunogenicity</u></h4>
                <p>As with all therapeutic proteins, there is the potential for immunogenicity with SKYRIZI. The
                    detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the
                    assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity (including neutralising
                    antibody) in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology,
                    sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying
                    disease. For these reasons, comparison of incidence of antibodies to risankizumab with the
                    incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading.</p>
                <p>For subjects treated with SKYRIZI at the recommended clinical dose for up to 52 weeks in
                    psoriasis clinical trials, treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies
                    were detected in 24% (263/1079) and 14% (150/1079) of evaluated subjects, respectively</p>
                <p>For most subjects, antibodies to risankizumab including neutralising antibodies were not
                    associated with changes in clinical response or safety. Among the few subjects (approximately
                    1%; 7/1 000 at Week 16 and 6/598 at Week 52) with high antibody titres (>128), clinical
                    response appeared to be reduced. </p>

                <h4><u>Reporting suspected adverse effects</u></h4>
                <p>Reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important.
                    It allows continued monitoring of the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product. In Australia,
                    healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions at

                        <p>ATC code: L04AC18.
                            In a study of subjects with psoriasis, expression of genes associated with the IL-23/IL-17 axis
                            was decreased in the skin after single doses of risankizumab. Reductions in epidermal
                            thickness, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and expression of psoriatic disease markers were
                            also observed in psoriatic lesions.</p>
                        <h4><u>Mechanism of action</u></h4>
                        <p>Risankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively
                            binds with high affinity to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine and inhibits
                            its interaction with the IL-23 receptor complex. IL-23 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is
                            involved in inflammatory and immune responses. IL-23 supports the development,
                            maintenance and activation of Th17 cells, which produces IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22, as well
                            as other pro-inflammatory cytokines, and plays a key role in driving inflammatory autoimmune
                            diseases, such as psoriasis. IL-23 is up-regulated in lesional skin in comparison to nonlesional skin of patients with plaque psoriasis. By blocking IL-23 from binding to its receptor,
                            risankizumab inhibits IL-23-dependent cell signalling and release of pro-inflammatory
                            cytokines.</p>
                        <p>Risankizumab does not bind to human IL-12, which shares the p40 subunit with IL-23.</p>

                        <h4><u>Clinical trials</u></h4>
                        <p>The efficacy and safety of SKYRIZI was assessed in 2109 subjects with moderate to severe
                            plaque psoriasis in four multicentre, randomised, double-blind studies (ULTIMMA-1,
                            ULTIMMA-2, IMMHANCE, and IMMVENT). Enrolled subjects were 18 years of age and older
                            with plaque psoriasis who had a body surface area (BSA) involvement of ≥ 10%, a static
                            Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score of ≥ 3 in the overall assessment (plaque
                            thickness/induration, erythema, and scaling) of psoriasis on a severity scale of 0 to 4, and a
                            Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥ 12 and were candidates for systemic therapy
                            or phototherapy.</p>
                        <p>Overall, subjects had a median baseline PASI score of 17.8 and a median BSA of 20.0%.
                            Baseline sPGA score was severe in 19.3% of subjects. A total of 9.8% of study subjects had
                            a history of diagnosed psoriatic arthritis.</p>
                        <p>Across all studies, 38.1% of subjects had received prior phototherapy, 48.3% had received
                            prior non-biologic systemic therapy, and 42.1% had received prior biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Of the subjects who had received prior biologic therapy, 23.7% had
                            received at least one anti-TNF alpha agent.</p>

                        <h4><u>ULTIMMA-1 and ULTIMMA-2</u></h4>
                        <p>ULTIMMA-1 and ULTIMMA-2 enrolled 997 subjects (598 randomised to SKYRIZI 150 mg, 199
                            to ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg, and 200 to placebo). Subjects received treatment at Week
                            0, Week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The results are presented in Table 2 and Figure 1.</p>

                            failure of a biologic did not identify differences in response to SKYRIZI among these
                            subgroups.</p>
                        <p>Improvements were observed in psoriasis involving the scalp, the nails, and the palms and
                            soles at Week 16 and Week 52 in subjects treated with SKYRIZI.</p>
                        ⁨
                        <h4><u>IMMHANCE</u></h4>

                        <p>IMMHANCE enrolled 507 subjects (407 randomised to SKYRIZI 150 mg and 100 to placebo).
                            Subjects received treatment at Week 0, Week 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Subjects who
                            were originally on SKYRIZI and had an sPGA response of clear or almost clear at Week 28
                            were re-randomised to continue SKYRIZI every 12 weeks or have treatment withdrawn.</p>
                        <p>At Week 16, SKYRIZI was superior to placebo on the co-primary endpoints of sPGA of clear
                            or almost clear (83.5% SKYRIZI vs 7.0% placebo) and PASI 90 (73.2% SKYRIZI vs 2.0%
                            placebo). More subjects on SKYRIZI had clear skin [sPGA 0 (46.4% SKYRIZI vs 1.0%
                            placebo) or PASI 100 (47.2% SKYRIZI vs 1.0% placebo)] at Week 16. Subjects receiving
                            SKYRIZI were also more likely to have a PASI 75 response compared with placebo (88.7%
                            SKYRIZI vs 8.0% placebo).</p>
                        <p>Of the 31 subjects from the IMMHANCE study with latent tuberculosis (TB) who did not receive
                            prophylaxis during the study, none developed active TB during the mean follow-up of 55 weeks
                            on SKYRIZI.</p>
                        <h4><u>IMMVENT</u></h4>
                        <p>IMMVENT enrolled 605 subjects (301 randomised to SKYRIZI and 304 to adalimumab).
                            Subjects randomised to SKYRIZI received 150 mg of treatment at Week 0, Week 4 and every
                            12 weeks thereafter. Subjects randomised to adalimumab received 80 mg at Week 0, 40 mg
                            at Week 1 and 40 mg fortnightly through Week 15. Starting at Week 16, subjects who were
                            receiving adalimumab continued or switched treatment based on response:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> Less than PASI 50 were switched to SKYRIZI</li>
                            <li>PASI 50 to less than PASI 90 were re-randomised to either continue adalimumab or switch to
                                SKYRIZI</li>
                            <li>PASI 90 continued to receive adalimumab</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Similar results for SKYRIZI at Week 16 were seen in IMMVENT as in other clinical studies
                            (Table 3 and Figure 2)</p>

                        <img id="image" src="TDPimg/Table3.png" alt="table3">

                        <p>For subjects who had PASI 50 to less than PASI 90 with adalimumab at Week 16 and were rerandomised, differences in PASI 90 response rates between switching to SKYRIZI and
                            continuing adalimumab were noted as early as 4 weeks after re-randomisation (49.1% vs
                            26.8%, respectively). 66.0% (35/53) of subjects achieved PASI 90 following 28 weeks of
                            SKYRIZI, compared with 21.4% (12/56) who continued to receive adalimumab. Other levels
                            of response were also higher following SKYRIZI: 39.6% PASI 100, 39.6% sPGA clear, and
                            73.6% sPGA clear or almost clear had response after switching to SKYRIZI, compared with
                            7.1% PASI 100, 7.1% sPGA clear, and 33.9% sPGA clear or almost clear who continued to
                            receive adalimumab.</p>

                        <p>In 270 patients who switched from adalimumab to SKYRIZI without a washout period, the
                            safety profile was similar to that in patients who initiated SKYRIZI after wash out of any prior
                            systemic therapies.</p>

                        <h4><u>Maintenance and Durability of Response</u></h4>

                            PASI 100 responders at Week 16, 79.8% (206/258) of the subjects who continued on SKYRIZI
                            maintained the response at Week 52. For PASI 90 responders at Week 16, 88.4% (398/450)
                            of subjects maintained the response at Week 52.</p>
                        <p>Among subjects with sPGA of clear or almost clear at Week 28 in IMMHANCE, 87.4% (97/111)
                            of subjects re-randomised to continued treatment with SKYRIZI maintained this response at
                            Week 52 compared to 61.3% (138/225) who were re-randomised to withdrawal from SKYRIZI.</p>

                        <h4><u>Absorption</u></h4>
                        <p>Risankizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics with dose-proportional increase in exposure
                            across dose ranges of 18 to 300 mg and 0.25 to 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously, and
                            200 to 1200 mg and 0.01 to 5 mg/kg administered intravenously</p>
                        <p>Following subcutaneous dosing of risankizumab, peak plasma concentrations were achieved
                            between 3 - 14 days after dosing with an estimated absolute bioavailability of 89%. With the
                            dosing regimen in subjects with psoriasis (150 mg at Week 0, Week 4, and every 12 weeks
                            thereafter), estimated steady-state peak and trough plasma concentrations are 12 and 2
                            micrograms/mL, respectively.</p>

                        <h4><u>Distribution</u></h4>
                        <p>In a typical 90 kg subject with psoriasis, the steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) was
                            11.2L, indicating that the distribution of risankizumab is primarily confined to the vascular and
                            interstitial spaces.</p>

                        <h4><u>Metabolism</u></h4>
                        <p>Therapeutic IgG monoclonal antibodies are typically degraded into small peptides and amino
                            acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgGs. Risankizumab is not
                            expected to be metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes.</p>

                        <h4><u>Excretion</u></h4>
                        <p>The systemic clearance (CL) of risankizumab was 0.31 L/day and terminal elimination half-life
                            was 28 days for a typical 90 kg subject with psoriasis</p>
                        <p>As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab is not expected to be filtered by glomerular
                            filtration in the kidneys or to be excreted as an intact molecule in the urine</p>


                        <h4><u>Drug Interactions</u></h4>
                        <p>A drug interaction study was conducted in subjects with plaque psoriasis to assess the effect
                            of repeated administration of risankizumab on the pharmacokinetics of cytochrome P450
                            (CYP) sensitive probe substrates. The exposure of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate), warfarin
                            (CYP2C9 substrate), omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate), metoprolol (CYP2D6 substrate) and
                            midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) following risankizumab treatment were comparable to their
                            exposures prior to risankizumab treatment, indicating no clinically meaningful drug interactions
                            through these enzymes.</p>

                        <p>Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that risankizumab exposure was not impacted
                            by concomitant medications (metformin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, amlodipine, ibuprofen,
                            acetylsalicylate and levothyroxine) used by some subjects with plaque psoriasis during the clinical studies (see 4.4 Interactions with other medicines and other forms of
                            interactions).</p>

                        <h4><u>Paediatrics</u></h4>
                        <p>The pharmacokinetics of risankizumab in paediatric subjects has not been established.</p>

                        <h4><u>Use in the elderly</u></h4>
                        <p>Of the 2234 subjects with plaque psoriasis exposed to SKYRIZI, 243 were 65 years or older
                            and 24 subjects were 75 years or older. No overall differences in risankizumab exposure,
                            safety and effectiveness were observed between older and younger subjects who received
                            SKYRIZI (see <b>4.3 Special warnings and precautions for use - Use in the Elderly)</b>.</p>


                        <h4><u>Renal or hepatic impairment</u></h4>
                        <p>No specific studies have been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment
                            on the pharmacokinetics of risankizumab. Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses,
                            serum creatinine levels, creatinine clearance, or hepatic function markers (ALT/AST/bilirubin)
                            did not have a meaningful impact on risankizumab clearance in subjects with psoriasis.</p>
                        <p>As an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab is mainly eliminated via intracellular
                            catabolism and is not expected to undergo metabolism via hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes
                            or renal elimination (see<b>4.3 Special warnings and precautions for use - Use in hepatic
                                impairment, use in renal impairment).</b></p>

                        <h4><u>Body weight</u></h4>
                        <p>Risankizumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases.
                            However, clinically meaningful changes in efficacy and safety of risankizumab were not
                            observed with increased body weight, therefore no dose adjustment is necessary based on
                            body weight.</p>

                        <h4><u>Gender or race</u></h4>
                        <p>The clearance of risankizumab was not significantly influenced by gender or race (Asian
                            subjects compared to non-Asian subjects including Caucasians) in adult subjects with plaque
                            psoriasis based on population pharmacokinetic analyses. No clinically meaningful differences
                            in risankizumab exposure were observed after accounting for body weight differences in
                            Chinese or Japanese subjects compared to Caucasian subjects in a clinical pharmacokinetic
                            study.</p>

                        <h4 id="Preclinical_safety_data">5.3 Preclinical_safety_data</h4>

                        <p>Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on repeat-dose toxicity studies
                            including safety pharmacology evaluations, and a reproductive and developmental toxicity
                            study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week (producing exposures of about
                            70 times the clinical exposure at MRHD).</p>

                        <h4><u>Genotoxicity</u></h4>
                        <p>Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with risankizumab.</p>

                        <h4><u>Carcinogenicity</u></h4>
                        <p>Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with risankizumab. In a 26-week chronic
                            toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week (about 70 times
                            the clinical exposure at the MRHD), there were no pre-neoplastic or neoplastic lesions
                            observed.</p>
